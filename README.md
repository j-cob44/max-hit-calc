3. Calculates your possible max hit against specific type, for example: kalphites on slayer task, fire bonus with tome of fire, or wilderness with Viggora's.
4. Calculates your possible max special attack against specific type bonus, for example: dragon longsword spec on slayer task.
5. Predicts required stats for next max hit and displays as a tooltip of the panel.
6. Predicts new max hit when hovering over an item in your inventory and displays as a tooltip.
