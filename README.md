# Max Hit Calculator Runelite Plugin

Features:
1. Calculates your possible max hit using melee, ranged and magic weapons.
   - Automatically grabs your currently auto-casted spell, no need for input anywhere
   - Currently only blowpipe is not calculated. All other weapons should work perfectly.
2. Calculates your possible max special attack hit for melee and ranged attacks.
3. Calculates your possible max hit against specific type, for example: kalphites on slayer task, fire bonus with tome of fire, or wilderness with Viggora's.
4. Calculates your possible max special attack against specific type bonus, for example: dragon longsword spec on slayer task.
5. Predicts required stats for next max hit and displays as a tooltip of the panel.
6. Predicts new max hit when hovering over an item in your inventory and displays as a tooltip.
